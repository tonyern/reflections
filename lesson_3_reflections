When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? I would do it for every project in case I lose my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? To give us full control over changes we made. If Git does it automatically, we might not remember all the commits made.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Fork is when I can make a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub and make my own changes to it but not their's. Clone is making a copy of a repository to your local machine. Branch is separate from the master where the user can make experimental changes. It depends on the situation on when you use one or another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? We can see it easily.
