What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? When we initialize a repository, it creates the .git files. We need to do it because so it can track commits and files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? Staging contains files that are committed and changes are made on it. The files are getting ready to be committed but not there yet for it to be in the repository. I think it can be a good snapshot of keeping track of files I have committed so far.
